EmoLib: Emotional Library
=========================

This INSTALL file explains the compilation process that
has to be carried out in order to obtain a binary
runnable distribution of EmoLib.

The folder where this file is located is referred to as the
root folder, "/emolib", and contains the 
source code files, dependencies, and all the needed resources
for the project.

Once in the root folder, the Apache Ant builder will be in charge
of the compilation process just by typing

    ant

The bytecodes of the library should be obtained within
a few seconds.

At the end of the process, three new folders should have been created:

- /build: This folder contains all the built bytecodes of the project.
- /dist: This folder contains the distribution files of the project,
        which correspond to the compression of the bytecodes.
- /doc: This folder contains the documentation, i.e. the javadocs.

Bear in mind that the build tool of use with EmoLib, which is
Apache Ant, needs to have extra libraries in order to be able
to manage JavaCC as one of its tasks, for example. If the operating 
system of choice to develop EmoLib is Debian GNU/Linux, then the
apt repositories (Etch release at least) yield the "ant-optional"
package which provides these extra libraries.
Otherwise, refer to the project's main website available at:

    http://ant.apache.org/

The most useful resulting file is the distribution JAR of the project
available in the "/dist" folder. This compressed file can then be
included in the classpath of an application to profit from
any benefits that EmoLib may offer.

Please ensure that the XML configuration file for EmoLib has the
correct paths to the needed resources.
In order to ensure its correct configuration, run the
"customise_path.sh" bash script in the "/conf" folder.
