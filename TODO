* Adverbs ending with -mente could contain affective information, the lexer
discards them. --> Weighting
Sugimoto (3.2. Emotion Classification) supports this statement.

* The "isimo" can't be removed by Snowball.

* Coreference resolution -> Daume & Marcu

* SentiWordNet for opininon mining -> positive/neg impressions

* Sentiment assessment -> sensenet

* Meta-emotions

* Include abbreviations in the tokenizer (lexer), so far, no abbreviations are allowed.

* Emotion dynamics, how emotion changes in speech. --> HTMM

* Locutions.

* Exclamations should raise the values of the emotions.

* SLM for emotion language.

* Grammatical weakness (Osherenko's paper): the bag-of-words of the EKS limits
the systems.
    * uses FWF.

* Shallow parsing techniques (MINIPAR).

* FindBugs, PMD

* In the ARN-R
    * code IDF (from LSA)
    * code intercept feature (avoid disconnected graphs).
    * incorporate MPQA dictionary of sentiment
        * http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~wiebe/resources.html
    * define appropriate supervised TW with classification.
        * Review Lan Tan.
        * Lan Tan's ITF TW method.
    * Pattern Length

* Check Logistic learning params. and optim. methods.

* Check LSA learning params. and optim. methods.
