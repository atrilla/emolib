EmoLib: Emotional Library
=========================

The organization of the source code release of EmoLib is as follows:

+ emolib/
  + build.xml
  + ChangeLog
  + CHANGES
  + conf/
  + COPYING
  + CREDITS
  + HACKING
  + INSTALL
  + README
  + src/
  + TODO

The tree above can be easily obtained with the "ls -l" command on a
GNU/Linux console. In alphabetical order, the elements listed above are
described in the following lines. Probably yet many unknown concepts 
are to be found, especially if this is the first time the reader
deals with the project. There's no worry to take care of since in
the documentation every aspect is described in detail.

>> emolib/
This is the root directory of the project. As it can be seen in the
tree, all the rest of the elements are descendants of this parent
folder. All elements should be referenced with respect to this folder.

>> build.xml
This is an "ant" script file. "Apache Ant" is a build tool for Java 
projects. It defines the whole project compilation process with a
simple set of commands. For its usage instructions please refer to 
the INSTALL file.

>> ChangeLog
This text file indicates all the changes applied to the project's
sources. It is a good practice to edit it at least every time the 
source changes are commited to the code repository in order to keep 
an updated register.

>> CHANGES
This text file keeps a record of the main changes applied to the
project between version releases.

>> conf/
This folder contains the configuration files needed by EmoLib.

>> COPYING
This file contains a description of the rights granted with the
obtaintion of this source code distribution.

>> CREDITS
This text file contains a reference to all the projects that EmoLib
makes use of to run.

>> HACKING
This is the text file that the reader is reading at this moment.
It describes every file contained in the project root folder.

>> INSTALL
This text file describes the compilation process.

>> README
This text file gives a general description of EmoLib.

>> src/
This folder keeps the EmoLib source code files.
In this folder there should be encountered all the needed information
to run EmoLib successfully or contribute to the project's
developement and continuity.

>> TODO
The project's "to-do list".


Additionally, EmoLib needs some external resources to compile and
run. They need to manually copied from an external source (*). Then,
the following two folders need to be available:

>> data/
This folder contains resources needed either by EmoLib itself or any
of its dependencies.

>> lib/
This folder contains the necessary library dependencies to use EmoLib.
