    <p>
    EmoLib has been designed with modularity in mind. The whole system is described
    with a pipeline of text-data processors that produce the affective tagging
    pursued by this system.
    </p>
    <p>
    The best possible documentation about the usage of EmoLib is yielded by a simple
    example code. This one shows how to declare and initialise an instance of EmoLib,
    which accepts a plain text file and
    returns a XML results file with the appropriate affective information.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to use EmoLib, two essential parts are required: the
    <b>initialisation</b> and the <b>processing</b>.
    </p>

    <h1>Initialisation</h1>
    <p>
    This part is constituted by the declaration and instantiation of the basic
    components of EmoLib.
    The associated source code is shown as follows:<br><br>
    <code>
            // Location of the XML configuration file<br>
            URL configFile = new File("emolib.config.xml").toURI().toURL();<br>
            // Declaration and instantiation of the Configuration Manager<br>
            ConfigurationManager cm = new ConfigurationManager(configFile);<br>
            // Declaration and instantiation of the AffectiveTagger through the Configuration Manager<br>
            AffectiveTagger tagger = (AffectiveTagger)cm.lookup("&lt;language&gt;_tagger");<br>
    </code>
    The &lt;language&gt; tag above refers to the appropriate text processing pipeline configuration for
    the language of use according to the configuration file.
    </p>

    <h1>Processing</h1>
    <p>
    This part is constituted by the method and function calls in order to feed the system
    with the text to process and to retrieve the results produced by EmoLib.
    The associated source code is shown as follows:<br><br>
    <code>
                // Feeding of the system<br>
                tagger.inputData(text_paragraph);<br>
                // Repetition until no more paragraphs are left in the document<br>
                // Retrieval of the processed text<br>
                tagger.outputData();
    </code>
    </p>
    <p>
    A direct implementation of this code is available in the "emolib.util.eval.ExampleTextFile" class.
    </p>
