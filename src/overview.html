EmoLib is a library that extracts the affect from text
and tags it according to the feeling that is written or being conveyed.

<p>
The diagram below shows the general architecture of EmoLib:<br>

<br><i>Figure 1: Architecture diagram of EmoLib.</i>
</div>
</p>

<p>
The processing structure of EmoLib is built of several 
primary abstract classes that define
a sequential modular framework, i.e., a pipeline, 
due to the dependencies in the tagging process.
This pipeline is described in detail in the <b><a href="emolib/AffectiveTagger.html">AffectiveTagger</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
The actual (concrete) classes that perform the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks (identified in Figure 1 inside the Tagger block)
inherit the common language-processing-wise methods and functions defined by these parent
(abstract) classes. By following this specification, the system gains an additional degree of
flexibility, scalability and maintainability. This responds to the need of
obtaining a complete modular configurable framework for EmoLib.
</p>

<p>
The primary abstract classes that define the architecture of EmoLib are described as
follows:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/tokenizer/Tokenizer.html">Tokenizer</a></b> - Splits a text string into 
        individual units, called tokens, creating the data structure.
        These tokens are expressed in regular patterns as established by the grammar of the language.
        It is the INPUTTER of the pipeline.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/splitter/SentenceSplitter.html">Sentence Splitter</a></b> - Segments
        the incoming text into paragraphs and sentences.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/pos/POSTagger.html">Part-Of-Speech Tagger</a></b> - Disambiguates the
        function of nouns, verbs and adjectives in the sentence according to the context.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/wsd/WordSenseDisambiguator.html">Word Sense Disambiguator</a></b> - Determines
        the correct sense of the words according to the context and extracts
        the appropriate set of synonyms.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/stemmer/Stemmer.html">Stemmer</a></b> - Strips the suffix of words
        in order to index those which share a common meaning, thus improving Information Retrieval (IR) performance.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/eks/EmotionalKeywordSpotter.html">Emotional Keyword Spotter</a></b> - Determines
        the emotional dimensions of the words that have an affective content.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/statistic/Statistic.html">Statistic</a></b> - Computes
        the averaged emotional dimensions of the words in the text.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/classifier/Classifier.html">Classifier</a></b> - Labels the text with the most
            appropriate affective tag according to the affective attributes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="emolib/formatter/AffectiveFormatter.html">Affective Formatter</a></b> - Presents the obtained results
        in a usable XML format in order to integrate it as a tool into a broader project.
        It is the OUTPUTTER of the pipeline.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There's also an external monitor, i.e., the
<b><a href="emolib/util/printer/Printer.html">Printer</a></b>, to help show the information (data) 
that flows in the processing pipeline in order to check that the
different modules that build the chain work correctly.
</p>

<p>
The configuration issues are conducted by the 
<b><a href="emolib/util/conf/ConfigurationManager.html">Configuration Manager</a></b>, which receives the
specific configuration from an external XML config file. 
This system has been taken from the Sphinx-4 speech recognition project, so please
refer to the pertinent documentation on the configuration specifications
at the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/javadoc/edu/cmu/sphinx/util/props/doc-files/ConfigurationManagement.html">Configuration Management for Sphinx-4</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is believed that the availability of a simple code is the best possible documentation
in order to begin using EmoLib. See <a href="doc-files/EmoLibSimpleExample.html">EmoLib Simple Example</a>
for further details.
